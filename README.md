=========================================
 https://github.com/Mutinifni/VLC-OpenCV/


Project Description :

This project aims to control simple operations like play, pause and toggle volume of media played by VLC Media Player using gestures.

The project is coded in C++, and uses the open-source libraries, OpenCV and LibVLC.

OpenCV is used for gesture recognition, primarily using Haar features for face and hand detection.

LibVLC is used for the communication between the C++ program and the media player.


Usage :

Make sure you have OpenCV and LibVLC installed on your system.

Download the whole source code.

Compile using "compile.sh".

Run the executable created.

NOTE : Lighting conditions need to be bright, and a relatively distinct background is preferable.


Sharing :

You are free to share, modify, and use the code in whatever way.
